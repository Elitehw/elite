      <p>Welcome to the Elite Home Warranty Cookie Policy. This Cookie Policy specifically explains how we, our
        partners, and users of our services deploy cookies on https://www.werelite.com (the “<span>Website”</span>), as
        well as the
        options you have to control them. For additional information related to your data, please visit our Privacy
        Policy. Our <a href="https://www.werelite.com/privacy-statement" target="_blank">Privacy Statement</a> explains
        our principles when it comes to the collection, processing, and
        storage of
        your information.</p>

      <h3><span>WHAT ARE COOKIES?</span></h3>
      <p>Cookies are small pieces of data, stored in text files, that are stored on your computer or other device when
        websites are loaded in a browser. Cookies help websites know if the browsing device has visited them
        before. They are used to remember you and your preferences. For example, cookies help websites remember your
        geographic reason or whether you prefer a certain color to be shown on a website.</p>

      <h3><span>WHAT TYPES OF COOKIES DOES ELITE HOME WARRANTY USE?</span></h3>
      <p>The type of cookies used on most websites can generally be put into one of six categories: Strictly Necessary,
        Performance, Functionality, Flash, Tailored Content and Targeting. In order to provide you with the best
        browsing experience, Elite Home Warranty uses all of these categories on the Website. You can find out more
        about each cookie category in the chart below.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <h4>STRICTLY NECESSARY COOKIES</h4>
          <p>These cookies are essential, as they enable you to move around the Website and use its features, such as
            accessing secure areas. Without these cookies, some services you have asked for such as payment submission
            can’t be provided.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>PERFORMANCE COOKIES</h4>
          <p>These cookies collect information about how you use the Website, for example which pages you go to most
            often and if you get error messages from certain pages. These cookies don’t gather information that
            identifies you. All information these cookies collect is anonymous and is only used
            to improve how the Website works.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>FUNCTIONALITY COOKIES</h4>
          <p>These cookies allow the Website to remember choices you make (such as your user name,
            language or the region you’re in). For instance, the Website uses functionality cookies to remember your
            language preference. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you’ve made to text size, font and
            other parts of pages that you can customize. They may also be used to provide services you’ve asked for such
            as watching a video or commenting on a blog. The information these cookies collect may be anonymous and they
            cannot track your browsing activity on other Websites.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>FLASH COOKIES</h4>
          <p>We may, in certain circumstances, use Adobe Flash Player to deliver special content, such as video clips
            or animation. To improve your user experience, Local Shared Objects (commonly known as “Flash
            cookies”) are employed to provide functions such as remembering your settings and preferences.
            Flash cookies are stored on your device, but they are managed through an interface different from the
            one provided by your web browser. This means it is not possible to manage Flash cookies through your
            browser in the same way you would normally manage cookies. Instead, you can access your Flash
            management tools from Adobe’s website: <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/
            flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html" target="_blank">http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/
              flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html.</a></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>TAILORED CONTENT COOKIES</h4>
          <p>Tailored content cookies help the Website provide enhanced features and display content in a way that is
            relevant to you. These cookies help the Website determine what information to show you based on how you have
            used the Website previously. These cookies do not track your browsing activity on
            other websites.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>TARGETING COOKIES</h4>
          <p>These cookies are used to deliver advertisements that are more relevant to you and your interests. They are
            also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of
            an advertising campaign. They remember that you have visited a website and this information may be shared
            with other organizations such as advertisers. This means after you have been to the Website you may see some
            advertisements about our services elsewhere on the Internet.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3><span>HOW LONG WILL COOKIES STAY ON MY BROWSING DEVICE?</span></h3>
      <p>The length of time a cookie will stay on your browsing device depends on whether it is a “persistent” or
        “session” cookie. Session cookies will only stay on your device until you stop browsing. Persistent cookies
        stay on your browsing device until they expire or are deleted.</p>

      <h3><span>FIRST AND THIRD-PARTY COOKIES</span></h3>
      <p>Cookies may be set by us on <br><a>www.werelite.com</a> (known as “first party cookies”), or by third parties,
        such
        as
        those who serve content or provide advertising or analytics services on the website (“third party cookies”).</p>
      <h3><span>HOW TO CONTROL AND DELETE COOKIES THROUGH YOUR BROWSER</span></h3>
      <p>Most browsers provide for ways to control cookie behavior such as the length of time they are stored – either
        through built-in functionality or by utilizing third party plugins. To do this, follow the instructions provided
        by your browser (usually located within the “Help,” “Tools” or “Edit” facility). If you disable
        cookies, please be aware that some of the features of our service may not function correctly. You can find out
        more information about how to change your browser cookie settings at <a href="https://www.allaboutcookies.org/"
