      <h3 class="w-70">Home Warranties vs. Homeowners Insurance
      </h3>
    </div>

    <div class="homeowner__content justify-content-end mt-5">
      <p class="w-70"> Home warranties are not the same as homeowners insurance. Many times, homeowners insurance is
        required by law by your lender. Insurance covers natural disasters, fires and floods. If anything like this
        occurs, your insurance policy (regulated by the state and federal government) will provide financial assistance
        according to stated terms</p>
    </div>
    <div class="homeowner__content justify-content-end mt-5">
      <p class="w-70"> A home warranty is an optional agreement. These are regulated differently by each state.
        Companies that offer home warranties can offer different levels of coverage and different terms and conditions.
        You want to find a home warranty company that has clear contracts and covers the items in your home that are no
        longer under manufacturer warranty</p>
    </div>

    <div class="homeowner__content justify-content-end mt-5">
      <p class="w-70"> Home warranties protect homeowners from the enormous cost of repairing or replacing items that
        break down due to wear and tear. Appliances (like a washer/dryer, hot water heater or fridge) and systems
        (electrical, plumbing, HVAC) are essential to the function or your home and very costly to fix or replace. A
        home warranty service agreement gives homeowners access to a vast network of qualified service providers and
        peace of mind if a breakdown occurs</p>
    </div>

    </div>
    <div class="homeowner__content justify-content-end mt-5">

      <p class="w-70"> Home warranties provide coverage for the major systems and appliances in your home. When you
        first purchase a new HVAC unit or washer/dryer set, it will be covered for a short time by the manufacturer. If
        it breaks down in the first year or two, you’ll be able to get payment from the manufacturer to cover that cost.
        This is great and assures you that if it breaks down even while it’s new, you won’t be stuck with a major repair
        or replacement bill. But what happens once that manufacturer warranty has expired?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="homeowner__content justify-content-end mt-5">
      <p class="w-70"> What happens is that you, as a homeowner, are stuck with the full cost of repairing or replacing
        a broken down item in your home. While a microwave may not be very costly, consider what you would do if your
        furnace broke down? What about a major plumbing issue? All of these unknowns can cause a lot of uncertainty.
        Most people’s budgets aren’t prepared to handle costly breakdowns. To offset this serious concern, many people
        turn to home warranties</p>
    </div>

    <div class="homeowner__content justify-content-end mt-5">
      <p class="w-70"> Home warranty service agreements exist as a line of protection against unexpected repairs or
        replacements. Once the items in your home have aged out of a manufacturer warranty, you can buy a home warranty
        plan. These plans and policies are pretty simple. Typically, you will pay an annual fee and then receive a
        certain level of financial security should a covered item break down</p>

        company doesn’t come through. Even if it’s in black and white, some people just want to be better taken care of

                What is a home warranty?
              </mat-panel-title>

            </mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <p>A home warranty is a contractual agreement. This agreement provides you with
              coverage of basic home systems and appliances that break down due to natural
              wear and tear. Your specific agreement will detail the terms for repairing or
              replacing covered items. Elite Home Warranty offers best in class plans that
              provide the utmost transparency and peace of mind for homeowners nationwide.

                How is a home warranty different from homeowners insurance?

              </mat-panel-title>

            </mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <p>A home warranty is different from homeowners insurance. Homeowners insurance
              covers acts of God and natural disasters, such as fires and floods. This is usually
              mandated by a mortgage provider. Insurance is also regulated at state and federal
              levels. <br> <br>
              What insurance doesn’t cover is the basic wear and tear on appliances and
              systems in your homes. That’s where home warranties come in. A home warranty
              plan can cover your major home systems (such as HVAC, electrical and plumbing)
              as well as a selection of home appliances (such as refrigerators, oven, washer/
              dryer, etc.). This provides another layer of support and protects a homeowner
              from having to pay enormous costs for repairs and replacements in the home.
              Elite Home Warranty is the premiere provider of plans like these, partnering with
              homeowners and offering excellent coverage. Contact us to learn more.</p>

                Do I need both home warranty and homeowners insurance?
              </mat-panel-title>

            </mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <p>Homeowners insurance covers acts of nature and disasters. For example, if there
              is a severe weather event that causes damage to your home, that damage should
              be covered by homeowner’s insurance. Insurance is regulated by the government
              and is usually required by law as part of a title. <br> <br>
              In contrast, home warranties cover systems and appliances in the home. These are
              things not covered by homeowners insurance. Once the manufacturer warranty on
              an air conditioning or washer/dryer has run out, a home warranty fills in the gap,
              protecting homeowners from costly repairs or replacements. Insurance and a
              home warranty are two different services, both of which are needed if you are
              going to be fully covered.</p>

            </mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <p>Elite Home Warranty is proud to offer the best home warranty agreements in the
              business. Plans purchased through us come with the highest level of coverage,
              protecting you from costly repairs and replacements. Your specific plan will vary,
              but generally we cover common home systems (plumbing, electrical, heating/
              cooling) and common home appliances (washer/dryer, water heater, refrigerator,
              stove). Contact us or go here to see more about our home warranty agreements.</p>

                How much does an Elite Home Warranty cost?
              </mat-panel-title>

            </mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <p>Elite Home Warranty offers comprehensive coverage that protects you from costly
              repairs. Our agreements have fair terms. Homeowners pay an annual premium,
              which varies depending on the individual systems or appliances you have chosen.
              Another distinction of our warranty company is that we allow you to choose your
              own service fee. Before your agreement is final, you will get to choose how much
              you pay for service calls. To learn more about pricing that meets your exact needs,
              contact us.</p>

                What is a service fee?
              </mat-panel-title>

            </mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <p>A service fee is the amount of money you will pay to have a qualified, contracted
              service provider come to your home and assess damage for a claim. It’s important
              to note that Elite Home Warranty only works with supremely qualified and licensed
              providers. This ensures that you are getting the highest quality care. The quotes
              provided by these providers are the basis for the repair or replacement that
              follows. <br><br>
              Elite Home Warranty has a unique system where homeowners can choose their
              own service fees. You will choose this rate and get to keep it for the duration of
              your agreement term.</p>

                Can I get coverage for old appliances?
              </mat-panel-title>

            </mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <p>One of the benefits of home warranties is that older appliances can be covered.
              Home warranties don't cover items that are still under manufacturer warranty.
              Once an item has aged out of those agreements, home warranties can become the
              safety net for your budget. While there are some restrictions, many older
              appliances can still be covered by a home warranty</p>

              </mat-panel-title>

            </mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <p>Older systems, such as water heaters and plumbing, can still be covered by
              certain home warranty agreements. Some companies will require thorough
              inspections of these systems before providing coverage. Elite Home Warranty
              doesn’t require home inspections before offering coverage that protects you from
              costly repairs or replacements.</p>

            <p>Home warranty plans begin within 30 days of a signed agreement and payment.

            </mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <p>Some home warranty companies have exclusions or age restrictions that will keep
              you from getting coverage. It is important to speak with a representative and fully
              understand whether you will have to get an inspection or whether items in your
              home are ineligible for coverage. At Elite Home Warranty, we have comprehensive
              coverage that truly provides for you in your time of need. With us, you are almost
              always qualified. Contact us to get started.</p>

            </mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <p>Some home warranty companies will require a home inspection before getting a
              home warranty plan. With Elite Home Warranty, we do not have that requirement.
              You don’t have to have your home inspected before you are eligible for coverage.
              We will cover your systems and appliances, sight unseen.

              </mat-panel-title>

            </mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <p>All homeowners have unique needs. Depending on the home systems and
              appliances you have, you will require individualized coverage. Most home warranty
              companies require you to purchase pre-set, bundled packages. Not us! Elite Home
              Warranty provides the highest level of customization available to homeowners.
              This way, you only pay for the actual items you want covered. Get the ultimate
              freedom and peace of mind with your Elite Home Warranty plan.</p>

              </mat-panel-title>

            </mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <p>Elite Home Warranty offers annual plans for a monthly subscription fee. This allinclusive subscription
              will be subject to the terms of your individual agreement.
              One of the ways in which we are “elite” is that we allow a premium level of
              customization. In other words, you get to pick and choose what items are covered
              and even your own service fee. It will all be included in your monthly cost, with no
              surprises or additions. Contact us to learn more.</p>

              </mat-panel-title>

            </mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <p>If you have an agreement with Elite Home Warranty, you will save a lot of money
              when covered appliances break down. The average cost of repair or replacement
              far exceeds your monthly, even annual, premiums. Elite Home Warranty clearly
              spells out the terms for repairing or replacing with like items and we will hold up
              our end of the bargain. If a covered appliance breaks down, you simply need to file
              a claim and pay your chosen service fee. A qualified contractor will provide a
              quote for repairing or replacing the appliance.</p>

              </mat-panel-title>

            </mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <p>A home warranty covers basic appliances and systems in your home. Most
              commonly, these include things like plumbing, electrical systems, heating/cooling
              systems, washers/dryers, water heaters, garage door openers, stoves/ovens,
              dishwashers, refrigerators and more. In addition to basic appliances and systems,
              many home warranty companies will allow you to add on things like inground pools
              and sump pumps. You will want to contact Elite Home Warranty directly to learn
              about the coverage we offer for homes in your area.</p>

            </mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <p>Elite Home Warranty provides coverage for home systems, including heating/
              cooling/HVAC, plumbing and electrical systems. These systems don’t have to be
              new, they simply need to be well maintained. If they break down due to regular
              wear and tear, you can get full coverage according to the terms of your
              agreement.</p>

              </mat-panel-title>

            </mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <p>Elite Home Warranty claims can be filed online. This is a simple process that can
              be performed by logging in, paying your service fee and submitting your issue. We
              will clearly communicate the timeline for processing your claim and let you know

                Is a home warranty worth it?
              </mat-panel-title>

            </mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <p>Home warranties premiums cost far less than replacing even a single major
              appliance or system in your home. Homeowners nationwide buy home warranty
              agreements with Elite Home Warranty to protect them from costly repairs or
              replacements. This is an important way to protect your budget and ensure that
              you won’t be paying cash out of pocket if something breaks down.</p>

                How much money does a home warranty save me?
              </mat-panel-title>

            </mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <p>Home warranty plans can save homeowners a lot of money. If a refrigerator breaks
              down, it will cost hundreds of dollars out of pocket to buy a new one. If an air
              conditioning unit breaks down, it will cost thousands of dollars out of pocket to
              replace. Home warranties fill in the gap after a manufacturer warranty has expired,
              providing coverage to offset the cost of repairs or replacements in your home. At
              the end of the day, an agreement like this could save you thousands of dollars.</p>

              </mat-panel-title>

            </mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <p>Home warranties range in price, depending on what kind of items are covered and
              what agreement terms are in your contract. Whatever the range you pay for
              annual premium, it will be less than replacing an appliance or system in your
              home. Contact Elite Home Warranty to learn more about pricing and plans. </p>

                Can a home warranty pay for a new appliance?
              </mat-panel-title>

            </mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <p>Yes. A home warranty company may pay for a new appliance if it aligns with the
              terms of your agreement. In the event that a covered appliance is beyond repair,
              most agreements will stipulate the replacement of a like item. In contrast to many
              other home warranty companies, Elite Home Warranty covers you and will make
              every effort to replace your appliances with the same brands, colors and features.

            </mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <p>Home warranty agreements cover the appliances and systems in your house.
              There are a variety of ways in which this could work. If a covered appliance or
              system breaks down, Elite Home Warranty will mobilize our local team of
              contractors to get on the job and help you out. This may mean replacing or
              repairing the covered item. You will have to refer to the terms of your agreement to
              ascertain the extent of work a contractor can and will do in your home. Contact us
              if you have any questions.</p>

            <p>Elite Home Warranty was started with the vision for doing things differently: we
              aim to offer what is right and fair in every situation. Our leadership has spent
              decades in the home warranty industry. We understand that sometimes, in the
              interest of making a quick buck, home warranty companies have treated people
              poorly and made decisions that disadvantaged homeowners. We are committed to
              doing business with the utmost transparency. We work with homeowners and
              home buyers and sellers, creating a simple and clear process to get the coverage
              you need. We are here to protect your clients and your reputation.</p>

              licensed and insured. It’s important to us that anyone filing a claim gets the
              absolute best coverage.</p>

            <p>Our clear, black and white service agreements don’t hide behind legalese or a ton
              of unnecessary terms and conditions. It’s important to us that you understand the
              exact nature of the coverage you signed up for and all of the benefits you’ll
              receive. Simply access your original agreement to understand the items you have
              coverage for.</p>

            </mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <p>With Elite Home Warranty, our system is entirely online or over the phone.
              Policyholders can file a claim directly online. Once the service fee is paid, our local
              network will be activated to provide service as soon as possible.</p>

                Are older appliances and systems covered?

            </mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <p>Part of the benefit of a home warranty plan is the coverage of older home
              appliances and systems. We offer this without requiring you to get a home
              inspection. Contact us to learn more about our plans.</p>

                Does a home warranty improve real estate transactions?
              </mat-panel-title>

            </mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <p>A home warranty can improve real estate transactions because it provides a home
              buyer with an extra layer of support and peace of mind. Especially when
              purchasing a first home or older home, it’s important that cash flow isn’t
              compromised by an immediate breakdown. Homeowners can rest easy if there is a
              home warranty policy in place. When selling a home, this may be an important
              item to consider, as it increases the value of your home and makes it more
              appealing to buyers.</p>
