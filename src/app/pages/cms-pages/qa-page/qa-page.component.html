            <p>A home warranty is a contractual agreement. This agreement provides you with coverage of basic home systems and appliances that break down due to natural wear and tear. Your specific agreement will detail the terms for repairing or replacing covered items.

                How is a home warranty different from
                homeowners insurance?
              </mat-panel-title>

            </mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <p>A home warranty is different from homeowners insurance. Homeowners insurance covers
              acts
              of God and natural disasters, such as fires and floods. This is usually mandated by a
              mortgage
              provider. Insurance is also regulated at state and federal levels.
            </p>
            <p>What insurance doesn’t cover is the basic wear and tear on appliances and systems in
              your
              homes. That’s where home warranties come in. A home warranty plan can cover your major
              home systems (such as HVAC, electrical and plumbing) as well as a selection of home
              appliances (such as refrigerators, oven, washer/dryer, etc.). This provides another
              layer of
              support and protects a homeowner from having to pay enormous costs for repairs and
              replacements in the home.

            <p>Elite Home Warranty is the premiere provider of plans like these, partnering with

                Do I need both home warranty and
                homeowners insurance?
              </mat-panel-title>

            </mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <p>Homeowners insurance covers acts of nature and disasters. For example, if there is a
              severe
              weather event that causes damage to your home, that damage should be covered by
              homeowners insurance. Insurance is regulated by the government and is usually required
              by
              law as part of a title.</p>
            <p>In contrast, home warranties cover systems and appliances in the home. These are things
              not
              covered by homeowners insurance. Once the manufacturer warranty on an air conditioning
              or
              washer/dryer has run out, a home warranty fills in the gap, protecting homeowners from
              costly
              repairs or replacements. Insurance and a home warranty are two different services, both
              of
              which are needed if you are going to be fully covered.

              </mat-panel-title>

            </mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <p>A service fee is the amount of money you will pay to have a qualified, contracted service provider come to your home and assess damage for a claim. It’s important to note that Elite Home Warranty only works with supremely qualified and licensed providers. This ensures that you are getting the highest quality care. The quotes provided by these providers are the basis for the repair or replacement that follows.
            </p>
            <p>
              Elite Home Warranty has a unique system where homeowners can choose their own service fees. You will choose this rate and get to keep it for the duration of your agreement term</p>

                Can I get coverage for old appliances?
              </mat-panel-title>

            </mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <p>Yes, you can. At Elite Home Warranty, we have no age restrictions. One of the benefits of home warranties is that older appliances can be covered. Home warranties don't cover items that are still under manufacturer warranty. Once an item has aged out of those agreements, home warranties can become the safety net for your budget. While there are some restrictions, many older appliances can still be covered by a home warranty.</p>

            <p>
              Yes, you can. At Elite Home Warranty, we have no age restrictions.Older systems, such as water heaters and plumbing, can still be covered by certain home warranty agreements. Some companies will require thorough inspections of these systems before providing coverage. Elite Home Warranty doesn’t require home inspections before offering coverage that protects you from costly repairs or replacements.

            </mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <p>At Elite Home Warranty, all homeowners are welcome. Some home warranty companies have
              exclusions or age restrictions that will keep you from getting coverage. It is important
              to speak
              with a representative and fully understand whether you will have to get an inspection or
              whether
              items in your home are ineligible for coverage. At Elite Home Warranty, we have
              comprehensive
              coverage that truly provides for you in your time of need. With us, you are almost
              always
              qualified. Contact us to get started.

            </mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <p>Home warranty plans can save homeowners a lot of money. If a refrigerator breaks down,
              it will
              cost hundreds of dollars out of pocket to buy a new one. If an air conditioning unit
              breaks down,
              it will cost thousands of dollars out of pocket to replace. Home warranties fill in the
              gap after a
              manufacturer warranty has expired, providing coverage to offset the cost of repairs or
              replacements in your home. At the end of the day, an agreement like this could save you
              thousands of dollars.

            <p>Home warranties range in price, depending on what kind of items are covered and what
              agreement terms are in your contract. Whatever the range you pay for annual premium, it
              will be
              less than replacing an appliance or system in your home. Contact Elite Home Warranty to

            </mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <p>Yes. A home warranty company may pay for a new appliance if it aligns with the terms of
              your
              agreement. In the event that a covered appliance is beyond repair, most agreements will
              stipulate the replacement of a like item. In contrast to many other home warranty
              companies,
              Elite Home Warranty covers you and will make every effort to replace your appliances
              with the

            <p>Elite Home Warranty will provide home warranty agreements for the appliances in your

              These include things like your washer and dryer, refrigerator, stove, cooktop,
              microwave, and
              dishwasher. There are numerous, additional items that we cover. Contact us for a free

            <p>Elite Home Warranty provides coverage for home systems, including heating/cooling/HVAC,
              plumbing, water heater, garage door opener, and electrical systems. These systems don’t
              have
              to be new, they simply need to be well maintained. If they break down due to regular
              wear and
              tear, you can get full coverage according to the terms of your agreement.

            <p>Our plans cover one of each type of appliances and systems that are covered under your

              coverage.

              </mat-panel-title>

            </mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <p>Yes, you can. At Elite Home Warranty, we have no age restrictions. One of the benefits
              of home
              warranties is that older appliances can be covered. Home warranties don't cover items
              that are
              still under manufacturer warranty. Once an item has aged out of those agreements, home
              warranties can become the safety net for your budget. While there are some restrictions,
              many
              older appliances can still be covered by a home warranty.

            <p>Yes, you can. At Elite Home Warranty, we have no age restrictions.Older systems, such
              as
              water heaters and plumbing, can still be covered by certain home warranty agreements.
              Some
              companies will require thorough inspections of these systems before providing coverage.
              Elite
              Home Warranty doesn’t require home inspections before offering coverage that protects
              you
              from costly repairs or replacements.

            </mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <p>At Elite Home Warranty, all homeowners are welcome. Some home warranty companies have
              exclusions or age restrictions that will keep you from getting coverage. It is important
              to speak
              with a representative and fully understand whether you will have to get an inspection or
              whether
              items in your home are ineligible for coverage. At Elite Home Warranty, we have
              comprehensive
              coverage that truly provides for you in your time of need. With us, you are almost
              always
              qualified. Contact us to get started.

              waiting
              period may be waived. It can also be waived by providing us with valid home inspection
              documents that are not older than 90 days. Click here for full details.

              the first 90 days, it strongly indicates a pre existing condition. Most home warranties
              will not
              cover such claims, but we do. Most importantly, after the first 90 days you will have
              access to
              the full benefit of your agreement moving forward. Click here for full details.</p>

            <p>At Elite Home Warranty, we don’t believe in penalizing you for using our services.
              There are

              bounds, you
              should feel absolute freedom to file claims for covered items. You won’t be financially
              penalized
              for doing so.

            <p>All homeowners have unique needs. Depending on the home systems and appliances you
              have, you will require individualized coverage. Most home warranty companies require you
              to
              purchase pre-set, bundled packages. Not us! Elite Home Warranty provides the highest
              level of
              customization available to homeowners. This way, you only pay for the actual items you
              want
              covered. Get the ultimate freedom and peace of mind with your Elite Home Warranty plan.

              </mat-panel-title>

            </mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <p>Elite Home Warranty was founded on a pretty simple concept: homeowners deserve good
              coverage with fair terms at an affordable price. Unfortunately, many other home warranty
              companies don’t operate this way. We choose full disclosure, terms in plain English and
              open
              availability to plans and customer service reps at all times. With us, you can trust
              that we’ll
              follow through and do what we promise.

              From there, we will activate our network of qualified service providers to get to your

            <p>It is always our goal to move as quickly as possible to meet your needs. We understand
              that the

              crisis. That’s why we’re always standing by (online and over the phone) to help you out.

            </mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <p> Elite Home Warranty offers the most advanced customization in the industry. You can
              buy a
              fully customized plan that covers as little as one item in your home. We understand that
              everyone’s life and situation is different. That’s why we let you tell us what you need,
              rather than
              offering a limited set of bundled options.
            </p>

                6. The ability to increase caps on covered items.
              </mat-panel-title>

            </mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <p>Sometimes, you realize after you’ve signed up for a service agreement that you need
              different
              coverage. Elite Home Warranty is the only company that allows you to increase caps on
              covered items. When you want additional peace of mind and assurance of financial
              assistance
              in the event of a breakdown, we let you expand your coverage to meet the need.
            </p>

                7. You are not required to maintain maintenance records.
              </mat-panel-title>

            </mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <p> Many people buy homeowners because they live in older homes or have appliances or
              systems
              that have aged out of a manufacturer warranty. We don’t think you should be penalized
              for
              buying a plan with us. We won’t ask for maintenance records for covered items in your
              home. Of
              course, we strongly encourage you to regularly maintain your systems and appliances.
              After all,
              just because you’re covered doesn’t mean you should be careless.

                8. Licensed service providers and technicians.
              </mat-panel-title>

            </mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <p> A huge benefit of having a home warranty service agreement with Elite is our network
              of
              qualified service providers. All of the technicians we send your way are licensed,
              insured and
              vetted by us. When something breaks down and you’re in crisis mode, the last thing you
              want to
              do is shop for a qualified provider. We’ve got you covered.
            </p>

              <mat-panel-title>
                9. Ability to use your own chosen technician.
              </mat-panel-title>

            </mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <p> Have a favorite home service provider? That works, too! You can select your own
              service
              technician. As long as they are licensed and qualified to provide service (in your
              state), you can
              apply your regular service fee to the work they come out to do.

            </p>

          <mat-expansion-panel>
            <mat-expansion-panel-header>
              <mat-panel-title>
                10. There are no limits on the number of claims that you can request service for
                annually.
              </mat-panel-title>

            </mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <p> Many home warranty companies put strict restrictions on the number of claims you can
              file. But
              how can they predict what will happen in your home? Homeowners should get maximum
              coverage. We give you that, letting you file as many claims as you need to (within your
              caps).
            </p>

              <mat-panel-title>
                11. No age or brand restrictions.
              </mat-panel-title>

            </mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <p> Have a super old or super obscure brand/make/model appliance in your home? No worries.
              Elite Home Warranty won’t exclude an item from coverage just because of its age or
              brand.
            </p>
          </mat-expansion-panel>


          <mat-expansion-panel>

              <mat-panel-title>
                12. We match color, make and model on replacements when available.
              </mat-panel-title>

            </mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <p> A home warranty service agreement sounds great. Until they replace your dryer with one
              that
              doesn’t match or even fit your space. Not us. Elite Home Warranty will go above and
              beyond to
              find a similar color, make or model that fits into your home and looks great.
            </p>

                13. No depreciation policy
              </mat-panel-title>

            </mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <p> Even as you have coverage with us over the years, the items in your home will age. We
              don’t
              institute a depreciation policy that reduces your coverage to nothing. Instead, you’ll
              get as much
              coverage as possible for your appliances and systems.
            </p>

                14. Option to opt in for $0 service call fee.
              </mat-panel-title>

            </mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <p> With every home warranty company, you will pay a service call fee to the technician
              who comes
              to your home. Elite is the only home warranty company that gives you the option to pay
              $0! For
              an increase in your annual premium, you can opt to pay nothing when a provider comes to
              your
              home.
            </p>

              <mat-panel-title>
                15. We cover undetectable pre-existing conditions.
              </mat-panel-title>

            </mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <p> Undetectable pre-existing conditions are defects or mechanical failures to any covered
              items
              that could not have been detected by a visual inspection or simple mechanical test.
              Didn’t know
              anything was wrong? That shouldn’t disqualify you from coverage. And with us, it
              doesn’t.

              <mat-panel-title>
                16. Choose repair or replacement service or a cash payment.
              </mat-panel-title>

            </mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <p>Once a qualified service provider has diagnosed your appliance or system issue, you may
              prefer to get a cash payout rather than a repair or replacement. We give you that
              option! You
              may be eligible to get a cash payment for the total approved cost of the repair or
              replacement
              minus diagnosis fees.

                17. Added food spoilage coverage benefit.
              </mat-panel-title>

            </mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <p>When the fridge or freezer break down, our network will go into lightning speed to get
              you the
              help you need. But sometimes, the technician isn’t fast enough. If food spoils, it can
              cost a lot of
              money. And we want to help you out. We will reimburse you up to a total of $100 during
              the
              term for the spoilage of food stored in any covered refrigerator.

                18. Added lodging coverage benefit.
              </mat-panel-title>

            </mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <p>Did your furnace die in the winter? Air conditioner in the summer? Even your furnace
              can leak
              carbon monoxide. There are plenty of reasons why a breakdown may make it impossible to
              stay
              in your home. In the event that it does, we want to alleviate some of the cost.
            </p>
            <p>On one occasion per term, we will reimburse you up to $125 of your documented lodging
              expenses per day, for a period of one to three days and an aggregate reimbursement of up
              to
              $375. You are eligible for this if you are unable to live in the residence because of a
              covered
              breakdown.</p>

              </mat-panel-title>

            </mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <p>If any of the covered items must be repaired or replaced due to a breakdown, EHW will
              pay on
              each term a total of up to $100 in fees required to dispose of any covered items.

              </mat-panel-title>

            </mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <p>Sometimes, repairs require heavy equipment. EHW will pay each term a total of up to
              $250 in
              fees charged specifically for such use of cranes or other lifting equipment.

              </mat-expansion-panel-header>
              <p> Elite Home Warranty is a different kind of home warranty company. Whereas many home
                warranty companies exist to collect your premium and skip out on claims, we are
                genuinely here
                to help. Our founders spent decades watching homeowners get the short end of the stick.
                You
                buy service agreements like these because you want and need financial coverage. Elite is
                one
                of the only companies that actually has your back.
              </p>
              <p>Our plans have extensive inclusions (not exclusions) and extra bonuses (like advanced
                customization). Everything we do is meant to make your life a little easier. From our
                24/7/365
                online claims process to our specialty plans, like Elite Electronics or Elite Service Line,
                there is plenty
                to love about trusting us. And you can. So contact us today and we’ll get started on
                your service
                agreement.</p>

                agreement or hire a lawyer to interpret the fine print. We make it easy for you to
                select the
                coverage you need and we are always online to communicate with you.

                  Why should I use Elite Home Warranty?
                </mat-panel-title>

              </mat-expansion-panel-header>
              <p> Elite Home Warranty is on your side. Homeowners have enough to worry about. With
                Elite, you
                get an extra layer of protection. Once your appliances and systems have aged out of a
                manufacturer warranty, you are fully responsible for the cost of repair or replacement.
                For most
                homeowners, this is an enormous burden. The way to get coverage is through a home
                warranty
                service agreement.
              </p>

              <p>Compared to other home warranty companies, Elite stands head and shoulders above. We
                operate on a different level, choosing integrity over what’s easy and choosing
                transparency over
                a pitch. Our goal is to put you at ease, promising and following through with getting
                you what
                you need when you need it. This is a partnership that actually makes your life easier.

                  How is Elite Home Warranty different from other home warranty companies?

                </mat-panel-title>

              </mat-expansion-panel-header>
              <p> The home warranty industry is notorious for excessive exclusions, denied claims and
                inscrutable
                fine print. In contrast, Elite Home Warranty offers maximum inclusions, advanced
                customization,
                a simple claims process and clear terms and conditions. We can’t cover everything, but
                we
                cover as much as we can. We can’t accept every claim, but we will do our very best to
                accept as
                many as possible. Our goal isn’t to collect your premium and run. We are here: ready and
                willing
                to take your calls, communicate with you online, send you qualified service providers
                and put
                your mind at ease. Do what you love: we’ll take care of your home.
              </p>

                  How does Elite Home Warranty work with service contractors?
                </mat-panel-title>

              </mat-expansion-panel-header>
              <p> Elite Home Warranty has a great network of local service contractors. These are the
                teams that
                are mobilized when our clients file claims. All of our contractors are licensed and
                insured. It’s
                important to us that anyone filing a claim gets the absolute best coverage.
