        homes will
        have appliances and systems in good working order. Even then,
        sometimes they break down due to regular wear and tear. That’s

          <small> First, it’s important to know what a home
            warranty agreement will cover if something
            breaks down. Most home warranties have plans
            that include either systems, appliances or
            systems and appliances in a bundle. For a monthly
            premium, you will have the ability to file claims </small>

          <small> In the event that the system or appliance is
            repairable, there are some important differences
            to look out for. Some home warranty companies,
            for example, have long contracts full of clauses,
            caveats and exclusions. In some cases, you may
            find that while your appliance is covered, a specific

          <small> Because home warranties often cover homes of
            any age, a lack of maintenance is a huge issue.
            During a claim filing process, a home warranty
            company may request maintenance records. Even
            if they initially covered an item, a clear lack of
            recommended maintenance could nullify that
