                              A home warranty is a contractual agreement. This agreement provides you with coverage of
                              basic home systems and appliances that break down due to natural wear and tear. Your
                              specific
                              agreement will detail the terms for repairing or replacing covered items. Elite Home

                                  How is a home warranty different from homeowners insurance?
                                </mat-panel-title>

                              </mat-expansion-panel-header>
                              <p>A home warranty is different from homeowners insurance. Homeowners insurance covers
                                acts
                                of God and natural disasters, such as fires and floods. This is usually mandated by a
                                mortgage
                                provider. Insurance is also regulated at state and federal levels.
                              </p>
                              <p>What insurance doesn’t cover is the basic wear and tear on appliances and systems in
                                your
                                homes. That’s where home warranties come in. A home warranty plan can cover your major
                                home systems (such as HVAC, electrical and plumbing) as well as a selection of home
                                appliances (such as refrigerators, oven, washer/dryer, etc.). This provides another
                                layer of
                                support and protects a homeowner from having to pay enormous costs for repairs and
                                replacements in the home.

                                  Do I need both home warranty and homeowners insurance?

                                </mat-panel-title>

                              </mat-expansion-panel-header>
                              <p>Homeowners insurance covers acts of nature and disasters. For example, if there is a
                                severe
                                weather event that causes damage to your home, that damage should be covered by
                                homeowners insurance. Insurance is regulated by the government and is usually required
                                by
                                law as part of a title.</p>
                              <p>In contrast, home warranties cover systems and appliances in the home. These are things
                                not
                                covered by homeowners insurance. Once the manufacturer warranty on an air conditioning
                                or
                                washer/dryer has run out, a home warranty fills in the gap, protecting homeowners from
                                costly
                                repairs or replacements. Insurance and a home warranty are two different services, both
                                of
                                which are needed if you are going to be fully covered.

                                  Is a home warranty worth it?

                              </mat-expansion-panel-header>
                              <p>Home warranty premiums cost far less than replacing even a single major appliance or
                                system
                                in your home. Homeowners nationwide buy home warranty agreements with Elite Home

                                to
                                protect your budget and ensure that you won’t be paying cash out of pocket if something
                                breaks
                                down.

                                  How much money does a home warranty save me?


                                </mat-panel-title>

                              </mat-expansion-panel-header>
                              <p>Home warranty plans can save homeowners a lot of money. If a refrigerator breaks down,
                                it will
                                cost hundreds of dollars out of pocket to buy a new one. If an air conditioning unit
                                breaks down,
                                it will cost thousands of dollars out of pocket to replace. Home warranties fill in the
                                gap after a
                                manufacturer warranty has expired, providing coverage to offset the cost of repairs or
                                replacements in your home. At the end of the day, an agreement like this could save you
                                thousands of dollars.

                              <p>Home warranties range in price, depending on what kind of items are covered and what
                                agreement terms are in your contract. Whatever the range you pay for annual premium, it
                                will be
                                less than replacing an appliance or system in your home. Contact Elite Home Warranty to

                              <p>Yes. A home warranty company may pay for a new appliance if it aligns with the terms of
                                your
                                agreement. In the event that a covered appliance is beyond repair, most agreements will
                                stipulate the replacement of a like item. In contrast to many other home warranty
                                companies,
                                Elite Home Warranty covers you and will make every effort to replace your appliances

                                to be new, they simply need to be well maintained. If they break down due to regular

                                tear, you can get full coverage according to the terms of your agreement.

                              <p>Yes, you can. At Elite Home Warranty, we have no age restrictions. One of the benefits
                                of home
                                warranties is that older appliances can be covered. Home warranties don't cover items
                                that are
                                still under manufacturer warranty. Once an item has aged out of those agreements, home
                                warranties can become the safety net for your budget. While there are some restrictions,
                                many
                                older appliances can still be covered by a home warranty.

                              <p>All homeowners have unique needs. Depending on the home systems and appliances you
                                have, you will require individualized coverage. Most home warranty companies require you
                                to
                                purchase pre-set, bundled packages. Not us! Elite Home Warranty provides the highest
                                level of
                                customization available to homeowners. This way, you only pay for the actual items you
                                want
                                covered. Get the ultimate freedom and peace of mind with your Elite Home Warranty plan.

                              <p>Yes, for the first 90 days we will cover you for up to the total amount paid for in
                                your agreement.
                                Full coverage goes into effect on day 91 and you will have access to the complete
                                benefits of
                                your agreement moving forward until the end of the term. This limitation is only
                                applicable for
                                new agreement holders and will not be applicable on renewals when an agreement is
                                renewed.

                              <p>This policy exists because we do not inspect your home. Typically, systems and
                                appliances do
                                not break down without any symptoms unless there is a pre existing condition. If
                                anything
                                breaks down during the first 90 days, it means that the issue existed prior to
                                purchasing our
                                coverage. Most home warranties will not cover such claims, but we do. Most importantly,
                                after
                                the first 90 days you will have access to the full benefits of your agreement moving
                                forward.

                              <p> Elite Home Warranty offers the most advanced customization in the industry. You can
                                buy a
                                fully customized plan that covers as little as one item in your home. We understand that
                                everyone’s life and situation is different. That’s why we let you tell us what you need,
                                rather than
                                offering a limited set of bundled options.

                              <p>Sometimes, you realize after you’ve signed up for a service agreement that you need

                                coverage. Elite Home Warranty is the only company that allows you to increase caps on
                                covered items. When you want additional peace of mind and assurance of financial

                              <p> Many people buy homeowners because they live in older homes or have appliances or
                                systems
                                that have aged out of a manufacturer warranty. We don’t think you should be penalized
                                for
                                buying a plan with us. We won’t ask for maintenance records for covered items in your
                                home. Of
                                course, we strongly encourage you to regularly maintain your systems and appliances.
                                After all,
                                just because you’re covered doesn’t mean you should be careless.

                                do is shop for a qualified provider. We’ve got you covered.

                                how can they predict what will happen in your home? Homeowners should get maximum
                                coverage. We give you that, letting you file as many claims as you need to (within your
                                caps).

                              <p> A home warranty service agreement sounds great. Until they replace your dryer with one

                                find a similar color, make or model that fits into your home and looks great.

                              <p> Elite Home Warranty is on your side. Homeowners have enough to worry about. With
                                Elite, you
                                get an extra layer of protection. Once your appliances and systems have aged out of a
                                manufacturer warranty, you are fully responsible for the cost of repair or replacement.
                                For most
                                homeowners, this is an enormous burden. The way to get coverage is through a home
                                warranty
                                service agreement.

                              <p>Compared to other home warranty companies, Elite stands head and shoulders above. We
                                operate on a different level, choosing integrity over what’s easy and choosing
                                transparency over
                                a pitch. Our goal is to put you at ease, promising and following through with getting
                                you what
                                you need when you need it. This is a partnership that actually makes your life easier.

                          estate transactions. When you are buying or selling a home, a home warranty service
                          agreement can incentivize faster sales and add value either in negotiations or at the
                          closing
                          table. Elite Home Warranty service agreements are transferable, which makes them an ideal
                          addition to real estate deals. Contact us to learn more or read on for answers to

                          <p>Elite Home Warranty provides significant benefit to home buyers. Home warranties pick
                            up
                            where manufacturer warranties leave off. This means that if you are purchasing a home
                            that has
                            older home systems or appliances, a home warranty can provide peace of mind. You can
                            avoid
                            enormous out of pocket expenses, which expands your opportunities to buy homes that have
                            older or worn items. Mitigate the risk of buying a fixer upper or older home when you
                            purchase a
                            home warranty service agreement.

                          <p>Home warranties are a valuable bargaining chip during real estate negotiations, as well
                            as an
                            incentive that increases the value of your for-sale home. Buyers will be attracted to
                            homes that
                            are protected by a home warranty. This is especially valuable if you are selling an
                            older home or
                            home that has older appliances or systems. Having home warranty coverage can alleviate
                            any
                            concern that buyers may have about facing out of pocket costs. Contact us to learn how
                            you
                            can get your home covered and then easily transfer the policy once your home is sold.

                          <p>Elite Home Warranty is a different kind of home warranty company. We not only provide
                            generous coverage for appliances and systems, we have advanced customization options.
                            This
                            means that, after a home inspection, you may quickly identify specific items that
                            require
                            coverage and others that don’t. With us, you can opt into a service agreement that only
                            covers
                            those items, which saves you money on a premium and gets you the exact coverage you
                            need.
                            Elite also has specialty plans, which include electronics and exterior plumbing
                            coverage. We
                            provide ample benefits to home buyers. Contact us to learn more.

                          <p>If you are listing your home for sale, you know that any way to cast it in the best
                            light will attract
                            more qualified buyers. Many home sellers are concerned that an old appliance or system
                            will
                            hurt them in a home sale: and those things can have a negative impact. However, when you
                            present old appliances or systems along with a home warranty policy, you can alleviate
                            buyer
                            concern and improve your chances for a quick and easy sale.

                          <p>Elite Home Warranty is a different kind of home warranty company. We operate with
                            homeowners in mind. Functioning in a different kind of way—that aims to serve homeowners
                            with minimal exclusions and maximum customization—we rely on affiliates to spread the
                            message. Homeowners shouldn’t be denied claims on no grounds, subject to excessive
                            exclusions or need a legal degree to read an agreement. Instead, Elite Home Warranty is
                            committed to transparency, laying out all of the facts and giving homeowners as much
                            freedom
                            as possible. If you get the power of this offering, and its benefit to homeowners
                            nationwide, you
                            may want to promote us. If you promote us as an affiliate: you get paid. Simple as that!

                              A home warranty is a contractual agreement. This agreement provides you with coverage of
                              basic home systems and appliances that break down due to natural wear and tear. Your
                              specific
                              agreement will detail the terms for repairing or replacing covered items. Elite Home

                                  How is a home warranty different from homeowners insurance?
                                </mat-panel-title>

                              <p>A home warranty is different from homeowners insurance. Homeowners insurance covers
                                acts
                                of God and natural disasters, such as fires and floods. This is usually mandated by a
                                mortgage
                                provider. Insurance is also regulated at state and federal levels.
                              </p>
                              <p>What insurance doesn’t cover is the basic wear and tear on appliances and systems in
                                your
                                homes. That’s where home warranties come in. A home warranty plan can cover your major
                                home systems (such as HVAC, electrical and plumbing) as well as a selection of home
                                appliances (such as refrigerators, oven, washer/dryer, etc.). This provides another
                                layer of
                                support and protects a homeowner from having to pay enormous costs for repairs and
                                replacements in the home.

                                  Do I need both home warranty and homeowners insurance?

                              </mat-expansion-panel-header>
                              <p>Homeowners insurance covers acts of nature and disasters. For example, if there is a
                                severe
                                weather event that causes damage to your home, that damage should be covered by
                                homeowners insurance. Insurance is regulated by the government and is usually required
                                by
                                law as part of a title.</p>
                              <p>In contrast, home warranties cover systems and appliances in the home. These are things
                                not
                                covered by homeowners insurance. Once the manufacturer warranty on an air conditioning
                                or
                                washer/dryer has run out, a home warranty fills in the gap, protecting homeowners from
                                costly
                                repairs or replacements. Insurance and a home warranty are two different services, both
                                of
                                which are needed if you are going to be fully covered.

                              <p>Home warranty premiums cost far less than replacing even a single major appliance or
                                system
                                in your home. Homeowners nationwide buy home warranty agreements with Elite Home

                                to
                                protect your budget and ensure that you won’t be paying cash out of pocket if something
                                breaks
                                down.

                                  How much money does a home warranty save me?


                                </mat-panel-title>

                              </mat-expansion-panel-header>
                              <p>Home warranty plans can save homeowners a lot of money. If a refrigerator breaks down,
                                it will
                                cost hundreds of dollars out of pocket to buy a new one. If an air conditioning unit
                                breaks down,
                                it will cost thousands of dollars out of pocket to replace. Home warranties fill in the
                                gap after a
                                manufacturer warranty has expired, providing coverage to offset the cost of repairs or
                                replacements in your home. At the end of the day, an agreement like this could save you
                                thousands of dollars.

                              <p>Home warranties range in price, depending on what kind of items are covered and what
                                agreement terms are in your contract. Whatever the range you pay for annual premium, it
                                will be
                                less than replacing an appliance or system in your home. Contact Elite Home Warranty to

                              </mat-expansion-panel-header>
                              <p>Yes. A home warranty company may pay for a new appliance if it aligns with the terms of
                                your
                                agreement. In the event that a covered appliance is beyond repair, most agreements will
                                stipulate the replacement of a like item. In contrast to many other home warranty
                                companies,
                                Elite Home Warranty covers you and will make every effort to replace your appliances

                              <p>Elite Home Warranty provides coverage for home systems, including heating/cooling/HVAC,
                                plumbing, water heater, garage door opener, and electrical systems. These systems don’t
                                have
                                to be new, they simply need to be well maintained. If they break down due to regular
                                wear and
                                tear, you can get full coverage according to the terms of your agreement.

                              <p>Yes, you can. At Elite Home Warranty, we have no age restrictions. One of the benefits
                                of home
                                warranties is that older appliances can be covered. Home warranties don't cover items
                                that are
                                still under manufacturer warranty. Once an item has aged out of those agreements, home
                                warranties can become the safety net for your budget. While there are some restrictions,
                                many
                                older appliances can still be covered by a home warranty.

                              <p>At Elite Home Warranty, all homeowners are welcome. Some home warranty companies have

                                with a representative and fully understand whether you will have to get an inspection or
                                whether
                                items in your home are ineligible for coverage. At Elite Home Warranty, we have
                                comprehensive

                              <p>This policy exists because Elite Home Warranty does not inspect your home. Typically,

                                and appliances do not break down without any warning signs. If anything breaks down
                                during
                                the first 90 days, it strongly indicates a pre existing condition. Most home warranties
                                will not
                                cover such claims, but we do. Most importantly, after the first 90 days you will have

                              <p>Yes, for the first 90 days we will cover you for up to the total amount paid for in
                                your agreement.
                                Full coverage goes into effect on day 91 and you will have access to the complete

                                your agreement moving forward until the end of the term. This limitation is only
                                applicable for
                                new agreement holders and will not be applicable on renewals when an agreement is

                              <p>This policy exists because we do not inspect your home. Typically, systems and
                                appliances do
                                not break down without any symptoms unless there is a pre existing condition. If
                                anything
                                breaks down during the first 90 days, it means that the issue existed prior to
                                purchasing our
                                coverage. Most home warranties will not cover such claims, but we do. Most importantly,
                                after
                                the first 90 days you will have access to the full benefits of your agreement moving
                                forward.

                              <p>Sometimes, you realize after you’ve signed up for a service agreement that you need

                                coverage. Elite Home Warranty is the only company that allows you to increase caps on

                              <p> Many people buy homeowners because they live in older homes or have appliances or

                                that have aged out of a manufacturer warranty. We don’t think you should be penalized
                                for
                                buying a plan with us. We won’t ask for maintenance records for covered items in your

                                course, we strongly encourage you to regularly maintain your systems and appliances.

                                just because you’re covered doesn’t mean you should be careless.

                                coverage. We give you that, letting you file as many claims as you need to (within your
                                caps).

                              <p> Elite Home Warranty is on your side. Homeowners have enough to worry about. With
                                Elite, you
                                get an extra layer of protection. Once your appliances and systems have aged out of a
                                manufacturer warranty, you are fully responsible for the cost of repair or replacement.
                                For most
                                homeowners, this is an enormous burden. The way to get coverage is through a home
                                warranty
                                service agreement.

                              <p>Compared to other home warranty companies, Elite stands head and shoulders above. We
                                operate on a different level, choosing integrity over what’s easy and choosing
                                transparency over
                                a pitch. Our goal is to put you at ease, promising and following through with getting
                                you what
                                you need when you need it. This is a partnership that actually makes your life easier.

                        Elite Home Warranty is a great opportunity for buyers and sellers to make the most of real
                        estate transactions. When you are buying or selling a home, a home warranty service
                        agreement can incentivize faster sales and add value either in negotiations or at the
                        closing
                        table. Elite Home Warranty service agreements are transferable, which makes them an ideal
                        addition to real estate deals. Contact us to learn more or read on for answers to
                        frequently

                        <p>Elite Home Warranty provides significant benefit to home buyers. Home warranties pick
                          up
                          where manufacturer warranties leave off. This means that if you are purchasing a home
                          that has
                          older home systems or appliances, a home warranty can provide peace of mind. You can
                          avoid
                          enormous out of pocket expenses, which expands your opportunities to buy homes that have
                          older or worn items. Mitigate the risk of buying a fixer upper or older home when you
                          purchase a
                          home warranty service agreement.

                        <p>Home warranties are a valuable bargaining chip during real estate negotiations, as well
                          as an
                          incentive that increases the value of your for-sale home. Buyers will be attracted to
                          homes that
                          are protected by a home warranty. This is especially valuable if you are selling an
                          older home or
                          home that has older appliances or systems. Having home warranty coverage can alleviate
                          any
                          concern that buyers may have about facing out of pocket costs. Contact us to learn how
                          you
                          can get your home covered and then easily transfer the policy once your home is sold.

                        <p>Elite Home Warranty is a different kind of home warranty company. We not only provide
                          generous coverage for appliances and systems, we have advanced customization options.
                          This
                          means that, after a home inspection, you may quickly identify specific items that
                          require
                          coverage and others that don’t. With us, you can opt into a service agreement that only
                          covers
                          those items, which saves you money on a premium and gets you the exact coverage you
                          need.
                          Elite also has specialty plans, which include electronics and exterior plumbing
                          coverage. We

                        <p>If you are listing your home for sale, you know that any way to cast it in the best
                          light will attract
                          more qualified buyers. Many home sellers are concerned that an old appliance or system
                          will
                          hurt them in a home sale: and those things can have a negative impact. However, when you
                          present old appliances or systems along with a home warranty policy, you can alleviate
                          buyer
                          concern and improve your chances for a quick and easy sale.

                        <p>Elite Home Warranty is a different kind of home warranty company. We operate with
                          homeowners in mind. Functioning in a different kind of way—that aims to serve homeowners
                          with minimal exclusions and maximum customization—we rely on affiliates to spread the
                          message. Homeowners shouldn’t be denied claims on no grounds, subject to excessive
                          exclusions or need a legal degree to read an agreement. Instead, Elite Home Warranty is
                          committed to transparency, laying out all of the facts and giving homeowners as much
                          freedom
                          as possible. If you get the power of this offering, and its benefit to homeowners
                          nationwide, you
                          may want to promote us. If you promote us as an affiliate: you get paid. Simple as that!

                        <p>Elite service agreements cover a broad range of home appliances and systems. Our
                          homeowners will regularly replace common home appliances that include refrigerators,
                          washers/dryers, dishwashers and more. They will also regularly replace covered system
                          components, such as HVAC units, furnaces and electrical/plumbing.

                        </p>
                        <p>Unlike a lot of home warranty companies, we also cover specialty items such as
                          electronics or
                          exterior plumbing. All of this needs to be purchased. If you become a preferred
                          provider, you will
                          be an important resource for regular supply of items like these. </p>

                            What is a home warranty?
                          </mat-panel-title>

                        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
                        A home warranty is a contractual agreement. This agreement provides you with coverage of
                        basic home systems and appliances that break down due to natural wear and tear. Your specific
                        agreement will detail the terms for repairing or replacing covered items. Elite Home Warranty
                        offers best in class plans that provide the utmost transparency and peace of mind for
                        homeowners nationwide. Contact us to learn more

                            How is a home warranty different from homeowners insurance?
                          </mat-panel-title>

                        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
                        <p>A home warranty is different from homeowners insurance. Homeowners insurance covers acts
                          of God and natural disasters, such as fires and floods. This is usually mandated by a mortgage
                          provider. Insurance is also regulated at state and federal levels.
                        </p>
                        <p>What insurance doesn’t cover is the basic wear and tear on appliances and systems in your
                          homes. That’s where home warranties come in. A home warranty plan can cover your major
                          home systems (such as HVAC, electrical and plumbing) as well as a selection of home
                          appliances (such as refrigerators, oven, washer/dryer, etc.). This provides another layer of
                          support and protects a homeowner from having to pay enormous costs for repairs and
                          replacements in the home.
                        </p>

                        <p>Elite Home Warranty is the premiere provider of plans like these, partnering with homeowners
                          and offering excellent coverage. Contact us to learn more.

                          <mat-panel-title>
                            Do I need both home warranty and homeowners insurance?

                          </mat-panel-title>

                        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
                        <p>Homeowners insurance covers acts of nature and disasters. For example, if there is a severe
                          weather event that causes damage to your home, that damage should be covered by
                          homeowners insurance. Insurance is regulated by the government and is usually required by
                          law as part of a title.</p>
                        <p>In contrast, home warranties cover systems and appliances in the home. These are things not
                          covered by homeowners insurance. Once the manufacturer warranty on an air conditioning or
                          washer/dryer has run out, a home warranty fills in the gap, protecting homeowners from costly
                          repairs or replacements. Insurance and a home warranty are two different services, both of
                          which are needed if you are going to be fully covered.

                            Is a home warranty worth it?

                        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
                        <p>Home warranty premiums cost far less than replacing even a single major appliance or system
                          in your home. Homeowners nationwide buy home warranty agreements with Elite Home
                          Warranty to protect them from costly repairs or replacements. This is an important way to
                          protect your budget and ensure that you won’t be paying cash out of pocket if something breaks
                          down.

                            How much money does a home warranty save me?


                          </mat-panel-title>

                        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
                        <p>Home warranty plans can save homeowners a lot of money. If a refrigerator breaks down, it
                          will
                          cost hundreds of dollars out of pocket to buy a new one. If an air conditioning unit breaks
                          down,
                          it will cost thousands of dollars out of pocket to replace. Home warranties fill in the gap
                          after a
                          manufacturer warranty has expired, providing coverage to offset the cost of repairs or
                          replacements in your home. At the end of the day, an agreement like this could save you
                          thousands of dollars.

                        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
                        <p>Home warranties range in price, depending on what kind of items are covered and what
                          agreement terms are in your contract. Whatever the range you pay for annual premium, it will
                          be
                          less than replacing an appliance or system in your home. Contact Elite Home Warranty to learn

                            Can a home warranty pay for a new appliance?
                          </mat-panel-title>

                        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
                        <p>Yes. A home warranty company may pay for a new appliance if it aligns with the terms of your
                          agreement. In the event that a covered appliance is beyond repair, most agreements will
                          stipulate the replacement of a like item. In contrast to many other home warranty companies,
                          Elite Home Warranty covers you and will make every effort to replace your appliances with the
                          same brands, colors and features. Contact us to learn more about our agreements.

                        <p>Yes, you can. At Elite Home Warranty, we have no age restrictions. One of the benefits of
                          home
                          warranties is that older appliances can be covered. Home warranties don't cover items that are
                          still under manufacturer warranty. Once an item has aged out of those agreements, home
                          warranties can become the safety net for your budget. While there are some restrictions, many
                          older appliances can still be covered by a home warranty.

                          companies will require thorough inspections of these systems before providing coverage. Elite
                          Home Warranty doesn’t require home inspections before offering coverage that protects you
                          from costly repairs or replacements.

                        <p>At Elite Home Warranty, all homeowners are welcome. Some home warranty companies have
                          exclusions or age restrictions that will keep you from getting coverage. It is important to
                          speak
                          with a representative and fully understand whether you will have to get an inspection or
                          whether
                          items in your home are ineligible for coverage. At Elite Home Warranty, we have comprehensive
                          coverage that truly provides for you in your time of need. With us, you are almost always
                          qualified. Contact us to get started.

                            Is there a waiting period?

                        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
                        <p>Like most home warranty companies, we have a 30-day waiting period. If you are switching to
                          Elite from another home warranty provider and have proof of existing coverage, this waiting
                          period may be waived. It can also be waived by providing us with valid home inspection
                          documents that are not older than 90 days. Click here for full details.

                          agreement. Full coverage goes into effect on day 91. From then, you will have access to the

                          benefits of your agreement until the end of the term. This limitation is only applicable for

                        <p>This policy exists because Elite Home Warranty does not inspect your home. Typically, systems
                          and appliances do not break down without any warning signs. If anything breaks down during
                          the first 90 days, it strongly indicates a pre existing condition. Most home warranties will
                          not
                          cover such claims, but we do. Most importantly, after the first 90 days you will have access
                          to
                          the full benefit of your agreement moving forward. Click here for full details.</p>

                        <p>All homeowners have unique needs. Depending on the home systems and appliances you
                          have, you will require individualized coverage. Most home warranty companies require you to
                          purchase pre-set, bundled packages. Not us! Elite Home Warranty provides the highest level of
                          customization available to homeowners. This way, you only pay for the actual items you want
                          covered. Get the ultimate freedom and peace of mind with your Elite Home Warranty plan.

                        <p>You can cancel your agreement at any time. We do have up to 60 days full refund benefit which
                          takes place from the date of purchase. Full refund benefit is only available up to 30 days
                          from

                        <p> If you have an agreement with Elite Home Warranty, you will save a lot of money when covered
                          appliances break down. The average cost of repair or replacement far exceeds your annual
                          premiums. Elite Home Warranty clearly spells out the terms for repairing or replacing with
                          like
                          items and we will hold up our end of the bargain. If a covered appliance breaks down, you
                          simply need to file a claim and pay your chosen service fee. A qualified contractor will
                          provide a
                          quote for repairing or replacing the appliance.

                        <p>A service fee is the amount of money you will pay to have a qualified, contracted service
                          provider come to your home and assess damage for a claim. It’s important to note that Elite
                          Home Warranty only works with supremely qualified and licensed providers. This ensures that
                          you are getting the highest quality care. The quotes provided by these providers are the basis
                          for the repair or replacement that follows.

                        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
                        <p>Yes, our standard service call fee is $75 on each claim. We also offer higher service call

                        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
                        <p>Yes. Policyholders pay a service call fee for each covered item on each claim filed. You must
                          pay a separate service fee for each covered item. We do not combine and/or group related
                          items into one service call fee. You have the ability to file a claim for multiple items under
                          one
                          claim, but you will be charged a separate fee for each item. Click here for full details.

                        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
                        <p>Yes. Homeowners can use a specific technician as long as they are licensed in the state to
                          perform the required services. You can request to use your chosen licensed technician at the
                          time of filing your claim online or over the phone. Our 30 day workmanship warranty will not
                          apply when using your chosen technician, because that provider is outside our network.

                        <p>Yes, for the first 90 days we will cover you for up to the total amount paid for in your
                          agreement.
                          Full coverage goes into effect on day 91 and you will have access to the complete benefits of
                          your agreement moving forward until the end of the term. This limitation is only applicable
                          for
                          new agreement holders and will not be applicable on renewals when an agreement is renewed.

                        </p>
                        <p>This policy exists because we do not inspect your home. Typically, systems and appliances do
                          not break down without any symptoms unless there is a pre existing condition. If anything
                          breaks down during the first 90 days, it means that the issue existed prior to purchasing our
                          coverage. Most home warranties will not cover such claims, but we do. Most importantly, after
                          the first 90 days you will have access to the full benefits of your agreement moving forward.

                        <p>Our service agreement is very straightforward. We do cover the repair and replacement of any
                          covered items that break down during the effective term of agreement. We have worked hard to
                          remove most of the standard industry limitations and exclusions to provide you with better
                          coverage. However, we have minor limitations and exclusions that we had to keep in order to
                          make our coverage fair for you and us. Honesty and transparency are our top priorities. Please

                        <p>Elite Home Warranty was founded on a pretty simple concept: homeowners deserve good
                          coverage with fair terms at an affordable price. Unfortunately, many other home warranty
                          companies don’t operate this way. We choose full disclosure, terms in plain English and open
                          availability to plans and customer service reps at all times. With us, you can trust that
                          we’ll

                          in the event of a breakdown, we let you expand your coverage to meet the need.

                        <p> Many people buy homeowners because they live in older homes or have appliances or systems
                          that have aged out of a manufacturer warranty. We don’t think you should be penalized for
                          buying a plan with us. We won’t ask for maintenance records for covered items in your home. Of
                          course, we strongly encourage you to regularly maintain your systems and appliances. After
                          all,
                          just because you’re covered doesn’t mean you should be careless.

                        <p> A huge benefit of having a home warranty service agreement with Elite is our network of
                          qualified service providers. All of the technicians we send your way are licensed, insured and
                          vetted by us. When something breaks down and you’re in crisis mode, the last thing you want to
                          do is shop for a qualified provider. We’ve got you covered.

                          technician. As long as they are licensed and qualified to provide service (in your state), you
                          can
                          apply your regular service fee to the work they come out to do.

                        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
                        <p> Many home warranty companies put strict restrictions on the number of claims you can file.
                          But
                          how can they predict what will happen in your home? Homeowners should get maximum
                          coverage. We give you that, letting you file as many claims as you need to (within your caps).

                        <p> A home warranty service agreement sounds great. Until they replace your dryer with one that
                          doesn’t match or even fit your space. Not us. Elite Home Warranty will go above and beyond to
                          find a similar color, make or model that fits into your home and looks great.

                          coverage as possible for your appliances and systems.

                        <p> With every home warranty company, you will pay a service call fee to the technician who
                          comes
                          to your home. Elite is the only home warranty company that gives you the option to pay $0! For
                          an increase in your annual premium, you can opt to pay nothing when a provider comes to your
                          home.

                        <p> Undetectable pre-existing conditions are defects or mechanical failures to any covered items
                          that could not have been detected by a visual inspection or simple mechanical test. Didn’t
                          know
                          anything was wrong? That shouldn’t disqualify you from coverage. And with us, it doesn’t.

                          may be eligible to get a cash payment for the total approved cost of the repair or replacement
                          minus diagnosis fees.

                          in your home. In the event that it does, we want to alleviate some of the cost.

                        <p> Elite Home Warranty is a different kind of home warranty company. Whereas many home
                          warranty companies exist to collect your premium and skip out on claims, we are genuinely here
                          to help. Our founders spent decades watching homeowners get the short end of the stick. You
                          buy service agreements like these because you want and need financial coverage. Elite is one
                          of the only companies that actually has your back.
                        </p>
                        <p>Our plans have extensive inclusions (not exclusions) and extra bonuses (like advanced
                          customization). Everything we do is meant to make your life a little easier. From our 24/7/365
                          online claims process to our specialty plans, like Elite Electronics or Elite Service Line, there
                          is plenty

                        <p> Elite Home Warranty is on your side. Homeowners have enough to worry about. With Elite, you
                          get an extra layer of protection. Once your appliances and systems have aged out of a
                          manufacturer warranty, you are fully responsible for the cost of repair or replacement. For
                          most
                          homeowners, this is an enormous burden. The way to get coverage is through a home warranty
                          service agreement.
                        </p>

                        <p>Compared to other home warranty companies, Elite stands head and shoulders above. We
                          operate on a different level, choosing integrity over what’s easy and choosing transparency
                          over
                          a pitch. Our goal is to put you at ease, promising and following through with getting you what
                          you need when you need it. This is a partnership that actually makes your life easier.

                        <p> The home warranty industry is notorious for excessive exclusions, denied claims and

                              A home warranty is a contractual agreement. This agreement provides you with coverage of
                              basic home systems and appliances that break down due to natural wear and tear. Your
                              specific
                              agreement will detail the terms for repairing or replacing covered items. Elite Home

                                  How is a home warranty different from homeowners insurance?

                              <p>A home warranty is different from homeowners insurance. Homeowners insurance covers
                                acts
                                of God and natural disasters, such as fires and floods. This is usually mandated by a
                                mortgage
                                provider. Insurance is also regulated at state and federal levels.
                              </p>
                              <p>What insurance doesn’t cover is the basic wear and tear on appliances and systems in
                                your
                                homes. That’s where home warranties come in. A home warranty plan can cover your major
                                home systems (such as HVAC, electrical and plumbing) as well as a selection of home
                                appliances (such as refrigerators, oven, washer/dryer, etc.). This provides another
                                layer of
                                support and protects a homeowner from having to pay enormous costs for repairs and
                                replacements in the home.

                                  Do I need both home warranty and homeowners insurance?

                                </mat-panel-title>

                              </mat-expansion-panel-header>
                              <p>Homeowners insurance covers acts of nature and disasters. For example, if there is a
                                severe
                                weather event that causes damage to your home, that damage should be covered by
                                homeowners insurance. Insurance is regulated by the government and is usually required
                                by
                                law as part of a title.</p>
                              <p>In contrast, home warranties cover systems and appliances in the home. These are things
                                not
                                covered by homeowners insurance. Once the manufacturer warranty on an air conditioning
                                or
                                washer/dryer has run out, a home warranty fills in the gap, protecting homeowners from
                                costly
                                repairs or replacements. Insurance and a home warranty are two different services, both
                                of
                                which are needed if you are going to be fully covered.

                              <p>Home warranty premiums cost far less than replacing even a single major appliance or
                                system
                                in your home. Homeowners nationwide buy home warranty agreements with Elite Home

                                protect your budget and ensure that you won’t be paying cash out of pocket if something
                                breaks
                                down.

                                  How much money does a home warranty save me?


                                </mat-panel-title>

                              </mat-expansion-panel-header>
                              <p>Home warranty plans can save homeowners a lot of money. If a refrigerator breaks down,
                                it will
                                cost hundreds of dollars out of pocket to buy a new one. If an air conditioning unit
                                breaks down,
                                it will cost thousands of dollars out of pocket to replace. Home warranties fill in the
                                gap after a
                                manufacturer warranty has expired, providing coverage to offset the cost of repairs or
                                replacements in your home. At the end of the day, an agreement like this could save you
                                thousands of dollars.

                              <p>Home warranties range in price, depending on what kind of items are covered and what
                                agreement terms are in your contract. Whatever the range you pay for annual premium, it
                                will be
                                less than replacing an appliance or system in your home. Contact Elite Home Warranty to

                              <p>Yes. A home warranty company may pay for a new appliance if it aligns with the terms of
                                your
                                agreement. In the event that a covered appliance is beyond repair, most agreements will
                                stipulate the replacement of a like item. In contrast to many other home warranty
                                companies,
                                Elite Home Warranty covers you and will make every effort to replace your appliances

                                to be new, they simply need to be well maintained. If they break down due to regular

                                tear, you can get full coverage according to the terms of your agreement.

                              <p>Yes, you can. At Elite Home Warranty, we have no age restrictions. One of the benefits
                                of home
                                warranties is that older appliances can be covered. Home warranties don't cover items
                                that are
                                still under manufacturer warranty. Once an item has aged out of those agreements, home
                                warranties can become the safety net for your budget. While there are some restrictions,
                                many
                                older appliances can still be covered by a home warranty.

                              <p>All homeowners have unique needs. Depending on the home systems and appliances you
                                have, you will require individualized coverage. Most home warranty companies require you
                                to
                                purchase pre-set, bundled packages. Not us! Elite Home Warranty provides the highest
                                level of
                                customization available to homeowners. This way, you only pay for the actual items you
                                want
                                covered. Get the ultimate freedom and peace of mind with your Elite Home Warranty plan.

                                begins from the date of purchase. The full refund benefit is only available up to 30
                                days from
                                agreement effective date. This is normally 60 days from receipt of purchase, unless the

                                waiting period has been waived. Click here for full details

                              <p>Yes, for the first 90 days we will cover you for up to the total amount paid for in
                                your agreement.
                                Full coverage goes into effect on day 91 and you will have access to the complete

                                your agreement moving forward until the end of the term. This limitation is only
                                applicable for
                                new agreement holders and will not be applicable on renewals when an agreement is

                              <p>This policy exists because we do not inspect your home. Typically, systems and
                                appliances do
                                not break down without any symptoms unless there is a pre existing condition. If
                                anything
                                breaks down during the first 90 days, it means that the issue existed prior to
                                purchasing our
                                coverage. Most home warranties will not cover such claims, but we do. Most importantly,
                                after
                                the first 90 days you will have access to the full benefits of your agreement moving
                                forward.

                              <p>Elite Home Warranty was founded on a pretty simple concept: homeowners deserve good
                                coverage with fair terms at an affordable price. Unfortunately, many other home warranty
                                companies don’t operate this way. We choose full disclosure, terms in plain English and

                              <p>Sometimes, you realize after you’ve signed up for a service agreement that you need

                                coverage. Elite Home Warranty is the only company that allows you to increase caps on

                              <p> Many people buy homeowners because they live in older homes or have appliances or
                                systems
                                that have aged out of a manufacturer warranty. We don’t think you should be penalized
                                for
                                buying a plan with us. We won’t ask for maintenance records for covered items in your
                                home. Of
                                course, we strongly encourage you to regularly maintain your systems and appliances.
                                After all,
                                just because you’re covered doesn’t mean you should be careless.

                                do is shop for a qualified provider. We’ve got you covered.

                                how can they predict what will happen in your home? Homeowners should get maximum
                                coverage. We give you that, letting you file as many claims as you need to (within your
                                caps).

                              <p> A home warranty service agreement sounds great. Until they replace your dryer with one

                                find a similar color, make or model that fits into your home and looks great.

                              <p> Elite Home Warranty is on your side. Homeowners have enough to worry about. With
                                Elite, you
                                get an extra layer of protection. Once your appliances and systems have aged out of a
                                manufacturer warranty, you are fully responsible for the cost of repair or replacement.
                                For most
                                homeowners, this is an enormous burden. The way to get coverage is through a home
                                warranty
                                service agreement.

                              <p>Compared to other home warranty companies, Elite stands head and shoulders above. We

                                transparency over
